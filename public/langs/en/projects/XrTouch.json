        "XRTouch is a school project I made with 2 other students.",
        "The goal of this project was to create real life devices that could give physical feedback to the user about his virtual environment.",
        "We used a Meta Quest 2 as a virtual reality headset and hand tracking device, and created a physical glove that could give force feedback to the user.",
        "The glove is made of a 3D printed shell, with servo motors and other components. The hole system is controlled by an Arduino, connected to a computer via Bluetooth serial communication.",
        "If this project interests you, you can find more information, assets, source code, and all on the GitHub repository!"
