        "BigyRenderer is a 3D renderer made during a 4th year project in computer science at the University of Lorraine.",
        "This renderer supports the reading of OBJ files, and their different associated textures (diffuse, normal, specular).",
        "The entire 3D rendering is done in C++ without any library and runs on the CPU.",
        "Only the loading and saving of images is done using the STB library."
