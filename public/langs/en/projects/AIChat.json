        "AI Chat is a chatbot that uses Chrome's built-in AI to communicate with you. It can answer your questions, tell you jokes, or even play games with you!",
        "It's a fun way to pass the time and learn more about AI. You can also use it to practice your conversational skills and improve your typing speed.",
        "This Chatbot uses Gemini's Nano model, which is a 3.5 billion parameter model with 4 bits of precision. Note that the webpage will not work if you are using a browser that does not have a built-in ai model."
